## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Vancence, an aspiring **Software Engineer** (specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**) who is currently seeking a summer tech intership! I currently pursuing my Bachelor's in **Computer Science & Design** with a Minor in **Artificial Intelligence** and a Specialization in **Software Engineering** at the **Singapore University of Technology & Design (SUTD)** looking to graduate in mid-2026. 

üî≠ I enjoy building projects as well as contributing to my team as a team player. Currently, as part of a module, I am working on EDITH a.k.a **E**vents & **D**eadline **I**ntelligent** **T**ask **H**andler which is an Android-based application that would help you optimize and schedule your ever-busy and messy calendar. Leveraging new technologies such as LLM and NLP, we hope that EDITH will be able to transform and improve efficiency throughout lives. I am also learning **Java - Kotlin**, **C** & **C++** while developing projects. 

ü§ø Outside of studying and tech, I enjoy exploring the unknown which is why my hobbies range from doing sports to hiking, and diving. Recently, because of the experience I had with diving, I took up a position in my school's diving club, **SUTDiving**, Executive Committee (EXCO) where I was a Treasurer, with my EXCOs we plan dive trips locally and abroad for the student body to broaden their knowledge on marine life as well as explore the depths beneath the waves. 

üìö I also love reading the news and books on startups, business, and financial literacy. My favorite ones include **Zero To One** by _Blake Masters_ and _Peter Thiel_ which talks about the future of startups and **The Smart Investor** by _Benjamin Graham_ which teaches one how to make informed financial decisions. 

‚úàÔ∏è I love traveling too. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to participate in a summer exchange held during 2023 where I went exchanged at **Yonsei University** in Seoul, South Korea. Additionally, I also participated in the **Freshmore Asian Cross-curricular Trip (FACT)** to Changchun, China during Fall, 2023. Lastly, as part of my dive trips, I was able to dive at Tioman Island, Malaysia together with my friends.
